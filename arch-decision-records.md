### ADR 1: Deployment Model - Cloud-Based vs On-Premises
**Decision:** Adopt a cloud-based deployment model for the system.
**Context:** Given the operational needs for flexibility, scalability, and remote access, a cloud-based solution is ideal for clinics that may lack extensive IT infrastructure.
**Consequences:** This approach offers enhanced scalability and accessibility but relies on dependable internet connectivity and involves recurring subscription costs. It also simplifies system updates and maintenance.
**Status:** Accepted

### ADR 2: Compliance with Data Protection Regulations
**Decision:** Implement a data storage solution that adheres strictly to HIPAA and other relevant health data protection regulations.
**Context:** Clinics handle sensitive health data requiring stringent data protection to avoid breaches and ensure privacy.
**Consequences:** Ensures robust data security and legal compliance, increasing trust but requiring careful architecture and potentially higher operational costs to maintain compliance standards.
**Status:** Accepted

### ADR 3: System Integration with Existing Software
**Decision:** Develop the system with modular architecture and open APIs to facilitate integration with existing EHR and practice management software.
**Context:** Clinics already use various software systems; hence, seamless integration is essential to ensure continuous workflow and data integrity.
**Consequences:** Enhances user adoption and operational efficiency but requires rigorous integration testing and maintenance to handle data interchange and potential software interface conflicts.
**Status:** Accepted

### ADR 4: User Interface and Experience Design
**Decision:** Focus on creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface optimized for various user proficiency levels.
**Context:** The system's effectiveness depends significantly on its usability across diverse clinic staff, including those with limited tech expertise.
**Consequences:** Reduces the learning curve and enhances user engagement but might increase upfront design and development efforts to ensure accessibility and ease of use.
**Status:** Accepted

### ADR 5: Advanced Reporting and Analytical Capabilities
**Decision:** Integrate advanced analytics and flexible, customizable reporting tools within the system.
**Context:** Clinics need to generate detailed reports for clinical decisions, compliance, and operational management, necessitating robust analytics capabilities.
**Consequences:** Provides critical insights and supports data-driven decisions, enhancing clinic services but requiring advanced data processing tools and potentially increasing the complexity of the system.
**Status:** Accepted
