# ADRs for Health care management system

## ADR 1: Deployment Model - Cloud-Based vs On-Premises

**Decision:** Adopt a cloud-based deployment model for the system.

**Context:** Business strategy of the product is to create a reusable lite version of health care management software that can be easily installed and configured for small to medium sized private clinics. Keeping business strategy in ming, product should have flexibility, scalability, and remote access. A medium sized clinic lacks extensive IT infrastructure.

**Rationale:** As major demographic for the product is a small to medium sized clinic, cloud based product will be right deployment to allow sclability, flexibility as per user usage.

**Consequences:** This approach offers enhanced scalability and accessibility but relies on dependable internet connectivity and involves recurring subscription costs. It also simplifies system updates and maintenance.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR 2: Compliance with Data Protection Regulations

**Decision:** Implement a data storage solution that adheres strictly to HIPAA and other relevant health data protection regulations.

**Context:** Clinics handle sensitive health data requiring stringent data protection to avoid breaches and ensure privacy.

**Consequences:** Ensures robust data security and legal compliance, increasing trust but requiring careful architecture and potentially higher operational costs to maintain compliance standards.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR 3: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan

**Decision:** Implement a comprehensive disaster recovery plan with regular backups and data replication to a geographically separate location.

**Context:** Need to ensure system availability and data integrity in case of outages or disruptions.

**Alternatives Considered:** Less frequent backups, relying solely on local storage.

**Consequences:**

* **Benefits:** Minimized downtime, reduced data loss, improved patient care continuity.

* **Drawbacks:** Additional infrastructure and maintenance costs.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR 4: Authentication and Authorization

**Decision:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and RBAC for secure access to patient data

**Context:** Need to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive patient information.

**Alternatives Considered:**

* Single-factor authentication.

**Consequences:**

* Enhanced security, compliance with HIPAA regulations.
* Potential inconvenience for users with additional login steps.

**Status:** Accepted

## ADR 5: Advanced Reporting and Analytical Capabilities

**Decision:** Integrate advanced analytics and flexible, customizable reporting tools within the system.

**Context:** Clinics need to generate detailed reports for clinical decisions, compliance, and operational management, necessitating robust analytics capabilities.

**Consequences:** Provides critical insights and supports data-driven decisions, enhancing clinic services but requiring advanced data processing tools and potentially increasing the complexity of the system.

**Status:** Accepted
